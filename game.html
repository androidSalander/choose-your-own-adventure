      <div id="felix">
        <p>In addition to a Supreme Sourt (H√∂gsta Domstolen), Sweden also has a Supreme Administrative Court (H√∂gsta F√∂rvaltningsdomstolen).
          Administrative court deals with matters of public law, often relating to executive brances of government.
          Examples include taxation and immigration.</p>
        <p>LISBETH SALANDER was working on a routine background investigation. A man named Felix Lunderstr√∂m applied to work in the offices
          of the Supreme Administrative Court. Anyone else under Armansky's employment would have found nothing out of the ordinary.
          But with Salander's illegal and morally questionable methods, she discovered Herr Lundstr√∂m broke some laws of his own.
          Fortunately for her, Lundstr√∂m was sloppy. He restricted most of his illegal activity to the deep web, where he traded weapons
          and purchased illicit substances on a regular basis. But he would occasionally message contacts outside of the deep web using a form of encryption
          which was painfully simple for Salander to decode. She found his handle, "law_breaker", and rolled her eyes.
          Normally she would've typed up her report and had it on Armansky's desk in no time, and let him deal with the criminal proceedings
          Lundstr√∂m's activity was bound to provoke. But she had found something far more interesting than petty crime...</p>

      <div id="joen" class="hidden">
        <p>Salander found messages from Felix Lunderstr√∂m aka law_breaker to Supreme Administrative Court Justice Joen Westermarck.
          She hadn't found anything to explain what they were about, but Westermarck essentially yelled at Lundstr√∂m,
          telling him he's a fool for playing fast and loose with his secretive online contacts in this way.
          <em>Justice Westermarck will likely be more of a challenge</em> Salander thought, and cracked a crooked smile before moving on.
          She emailed Armansky to let him know this background check is a little involved, she needs more time.
          For hours she scoured the web for any information indicating Westermarck's criminal involvement, finding nothing.
          The only indication that anything was amiss were occasional gaps in time, a summer holiday, or mysterious illness.
          His calendars suggested he spent a lot of time travelling through Europe or overseas on weekends, but there were no travel statements
          in his bank accounts indicating he purchased flights to any of these places. She almost considered giving up, this might be a waste of time.
          <em>Maybe he just bought some drugs off of Lunderstr√∂m, or some fancy hunting rifle.</em> Her phone rang, interrupting her thoughts. It was Armansky.</p>
        <div class="dialogue">
          <p>"Hello?"</p>
          <p>"Hey, just letting you know you can drop the Lunderstr√∂m case."</p>
          <p>"What? Why?"</p>
          <p>"Hell if I know, the client says they're not going to hire him so the background check would be useless."</p>
          <p>"Who exactly? Someone from the court office?"</p>
          <p>"They told me it was an urgent request from one of the justices. Not sure why they're in such a hurry,
            but they're still paying you in full, so don't worry about it."</p>
          <p><em>Westermarck. It has to be.</em></p>
          <p>"Thanks."</p>
          <p>She hung up. <em>It's so obvious. Westermarck won't work with Lunderstr√∂m because he knows that fool will land him in legal trouble,
            or worse. There's no way I'm giving up on this now...</em></p>

      <div id="email" class="hidden">
        <p>Salander guessed that Lunderstr√∂m would continue to be a sloppy idiot, so she checked his email.
          Half an hour ago <_law_breaker_100@hotmail.com> sent an email to a hidden address.</p>
        <p>"I'm sorry, ok?? You don't have to blacklist me."</p>
        <p>She had to laugh at that one. Especially because all of her assumptions had proved to be correct. A response from the hidden sender, two minutes ago.</p>
        <p>"Your stupidity continues to astound me. How many times have I told you not to contact me here? HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES??
          I swear to God if any of your bullshit gets back to me I WILL HAVE YOUR FUCKING HEAD. Understood? Never speak to me again."</p>
        <p>Obviously he was right to be so concerned. <em>What are you hiding?</em> Apparently something big, because not 5 minutes after it was sent,
          his email and the one from Lunderstr√∂m were both gone, deleted. Out of curiosity, she checked the emails she found earlier
          that first exposed the link between Lunderstr√∂m and Westermarck. Those had also been permanently deleted. She got to them just in time.</p>
        <p>Lunderstr√∂m was now officially a dead end, and Westermarck too paranoid to make such obvious mistakes of his own.
          But Salander had a trick up her sleeve. A special gadget invented by fellow hacker and tech genius Plague would give her access
          to any file on Westermarck's computer. But it would be tricky. <em>It's about time for some field work.</em>
          Plague had given her a couple of his clever gadgets to test out when she had the time. A small cuff she could wrap around
          a broadband cable to begin a hostile computer takeover, while remaining undetected. It would take time for the cuff to completely download
          all the data she needed, but it's well worth the wait. She went to bed early, tomorrow would be a busy day...</p>

        <p>Salander has to install the cuff on Westermarck's broadband cable so she can see what's on his personal computer, but she doesn't know where
          the cables in his house are located. How will she find out? Go back if you need to review your information.</p>
        <button type="button" class="back" id="choice-cuff-install-back-button">Back</button>
        <p>Call Westermarck's home pretending to be a representative from the cable company. Ask where in the house the broadband cables are located,
        and tell them someone will likely be by the house to check they're working correctly in the next couple of days.</p>
        <button type="button" class="choice" id="cable-rep">Call house</button>
        <p>Call the cable company pretending to be Westermarck's teenage daughter. Say there's something wrong with the wireless connections, and neither you nor your parents
        know where the cables are installed. The company should have a schematic and be able to tell you.</p>

          Smoking made for a good alibi. She stood outside and dropped her cigarette right next to one of the cables, quickly snapping on the cuff.
          She finished one, and smoked another while pretending to look impatient, checking her watch and pacing. Then she walked off in a huff.
          <em>Time to wait. Maybe Herr Westermarck has some other idiot accomplices I can look into in the meantime.</em></p>

      <div id="blomkvist" class="hidden">
        <p>In 1999, Sweden was the first nation to legalize the sale of one's own body for sexual services, and to keep the purchasing of those services illegal.
          This "Nordic Model" for the sex trade is now used in a number of other nations.</p>
        <p>MIKAEL BLOMKVIST woke up in Erika Berger's bed. Her husband was away on business. She was already awake and getting dressed.
          When she saw he was awake, she went over to kiss him.</p>
        <p>"Good Morning," she smiled.</p>
        <p>He yawned. "Do we have time for breakfast?"</p>
        <p>"Why wouldn't we? It's Saturday."</p>
        <p>"Oh," he chuckled. "I thought you were off to work. Why are you up so early then?"</p>
        <p>"It's 11:30 Mikael. I think you drank too much last night." She kissed him again and sat next to him.</p>
        <p>"I think you kept me up too late," he said as he flipped her over onto the bed.</p>
        <p>Sometime later, they were both getting dressed and planning to get lunch. As they went to leave, Blomkvist opened the front door
          to an unamused Salander.</p>
        <p>He jumped, "Jesus, what are you doing here?"</p>
        <p>"You didn't answer your phone and weren't at home so I came here," she said in her typical unaffected manner.</p>
        <p>"Well...do you want to get lunch with Ricky and I? We were just leaving." Salander glared at them both.</p>
        <p>Berger started to laugh, as Salander's glare intensified. "Why don't you two go, I think she has something important for you Mikael."</p>
        <p>Salander relaxed. Berger was right, after all.</p>

          follows not 5 minutes later. she asks for them to ring the room Westermarck just checked in to. whoever went in goes to get the other from the car,
          and they get their own room. salander hacks the hotel's files, remarking how easy it was. she finds the pseudonym Westermarck used to check in.
          now she has something solid to go off of. she turns off the computer and jumps blomkvist.</p>

      <div id="insomnia" class="hidden">
        <p>Salander wakes up in the middle of the night, excitable. blomkvist is fast asleep. she powers up her laptop and looks into some online escort services
          to see if she can find the woman Westermarck just hired. surprisingly, she is able to find her relatively quickly, under the name "Idun".
          it's a long shot, but maybe this woman can help them. she looks into Westermarck's alias Birger Lund√©n, a name that sounds oddly familiar to her,
          yet she cant place it. she could probably investigate this herself, but she wants to talk to Idun. maybe she could ask her hacker collective for help.
          after a couple of hours hunting Lund√©n on the dark web, her eyes droop. so she falls asleep next to blomkvist once again. when they wake up she tells
          blomkvist about what she found while he slept.
          salander suggests they hire Idun and ask her to talk to them. blomkvist balks at her rates. you can either send Idun a request on her page
          and ask plague to request info about Lund√©n, or have salander investigate him.</p>

        <p>if you decide to talk to idun, salander sends a message saying she wants to hire her for 2 hours just to talk, but they will still pay her rates.
        idun replies quickly and happily agrees and in fact says they can pay her half if they're just talking, scheduling the meeting for tomorrow.
        blomkvist's wallet is relieved. they have some time, so after some more ~celebratory fun~ in the hotel, the duo decides if they should take it easy,
        or stake out Westermarck again. "take it easy" is basically sex and dinner. stakeout leads them to Westermarck having dinner with some guy,
        blomkvist thinks he looks familiar but can't quite place him. uneventful.</p>

      <div id="idun" class="hidden">
        <p>you meet idun at a cafe. she is absurdly beautiful with long, thick, wavy, golden hair like the goddess whos name she has chosen.
          blomkvist is all but drooling, salander's eyes are much wider than usual. she does most of the talking. idun is as friendly and funny
          as she is beautiful. and smart too, she's actually an artist. she has been an escort for a few years and before that, a dancer.
          she's an artist's model for fun. blomkvist is surprised that salander is almost...chatty with her. she also tells them with a laugh like
          birds in spring that she's actually a lesbian, she says this only because it usually amuses people considering her profession.
          blomkvist laughs awkwardly, but feels strangely comforted and realizes he had been quite tense, so he relaxes. she tells them
          how amusing that new law is that makes her johns criminals while allowing her the freedom to continue as she pleases. after the banter,
          she gets a more serious look in her pale blue eyes. she asks what they *really* wanted to talk about. salander tells her about their
          investigation into Westermarck/Lund√©n and Idun laughs again, this time more of a throaty cackle.</p>
          <p>"If you promise to take that Nazi bastard down I'll tell you everything"</p>
          <p>she disliked his conservative political leanings but didn't know he was a nazi until last night when he showed her a photo in full uniform.
          apparently he collected memorabilia, and actively went to meetings. he had gotten it in his head that she would be his norse goddess.
          little did he know she was actually Jewish and born in Poland, the name merely expressed her love of pagan mythology. it took all her strength
          not to show her anger. she played along, and swore she would never see him again. her exterior cracked for a moment, a single tear fell down her
          porcelain cheek as she told them the fate of her grandparents during the holocaust.</p>
          <p>then she pulled out a digital camera, she had taken a photo of the photo while he was in the bathroom.</p>
          <p>"I wasn't even sure what I would do with this."</p>
          <p>salander asks if she can have the sd card, idun says there's a lot of other things on there but as long as she brings it back, she can have it.
          then idun says she has to go, looks salander in the eyes and thanks her before kissing her on the lips and walking out the door.
          salander is actually blushing, and slowly puts a hand to her lips. neither of them speak for a good while. blomkvist gets up and orders 2 shots
          of aquavit.</p>

        <p>theyve been doing a lot of research with their new information. plague sent a report from another hacker that showed Lund√©n bought a lot of Nazi
        paraphernelia online, as well as a lot of regular weapons. salander and blomkvist both remembered why Lund√©n's name and acquantaince were so familar.
        the name was compiled from 2 former nazi party leaders that salander had read about a long time ago. and blomkvist had written an article about
        officials with nazi ties that Lund√©n's friend had appeared in. it was all making sense now. he surely had some nazi agenda, they just didn't know
        what it was. he had managed to do a very good job keeping it hidden. they were able to uncover the location of a meeting place, and a meeting
        was being held tonight. they couldnt decide who should go. salander doesnt want to go because they hate women, and blomkvist because he's afraid
        someone might recognize him from the magazine and call his bluff. if you choose blomkvist, he gets beat to death in an ally and salander vows to
        kill everyone who was there with deadly poison. if you choose salander, she puts on her blonde wig and a conservative outfit. there are actually
        a couple of women there. security is very tight, but they wave salander through. theres a couple of government officials there but mostly seems
        like businessmen. they have a plot to "make sweden great again" starting with inciting a coup in Ghana, a former swedish colony, and taking over
        the government for sweden agian. they have members in key parts of government to keep slowly pushing policies more right wing. some of their ideas
        are almost laughably rediculous, but others are actually terrifying. salander makes it all the way through and meets blomkvist down the block.</p>
        <p>"Did you get it?" he asks.</p>
        <p>"Only one way to find out," she smiles.</p>

        like this in....remember to look up swedish govt scandals. now they have to decide what to do with the information. salander must always remain anonymous.
        possible choices-take it to the president of the Administrative court along with the criminal dossier of Westermarck/Lund√©n, Millenium publishes the story,
        take it to the police. ok, blomkvist takes it to the court president and he handles it and lets millenium publish the story. if millenium just publishes it,
        idk it's bad they break a law or they cant use the info or something. if they take it to the police, it gets hushed up and blomkvist is taken out by a hitman.
        salander goes on a vendetta to kill everyone involved with deadly poison. i think that's basically the end??</p>
