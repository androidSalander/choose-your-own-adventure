      <h1>Chapter 1</h1>

      <div id="felix".
        <p>In addition to a Supreme Sourt (H√∂gsta Domstolen), Sweden also has a Supreme Administrative Court (H√∂gsta F√∂rvaltningsdomstolen). Administrative court deals with matters of public law, often relating to executive brances of government. Examples include taxation and immigration.</p>
        <p>LISBETH SALANDER is working on a routine background investigation. A man named Felix Lunderstr√∂m is applying to work in the offices of the Supreme Administrative Court. Anyone else under Armansky's employment would have found nothing out of the ordinary. But with Salander's illegal and morally questionable methods, she has discovered Herr Lundstr√∂m has broken some laws of his own. Fortunately for her, Lundstr√∂m was sloppy. He restricted most of his illegal activity to the deep web, where he traded weapons and purchased illicit substances on a regular basis. But he would occasionally message contacts outside of the deep web using a form of encryption which was painfully simple for Salander to decode. She found his handle, "law_breaker", and rolled her eyes. Normally she would've typed up her report and had it on Armansky's desk in no time, and let him deal with the criminal proceedings Lundstr√∂m's activity was bound to provoke. But she had found something far more interesting than petty crime...</p>

        <p>Salander has found messages from Felix Lunderstr√∂m aka law_breaker to Supreme Administrative Court Justice Joen Westermarck. She hasn't found anything to explain what they are about, but Westermarck is essentially yelling at Lundstr√∂m, telling him what a fool he is for playing fast and loose with his secretive online contacts in this way. <em>Justice Westermarck will likely be more of a challenge</em> Salander thinks, and cracks a crooked smile before moving on. She emails Armansky to let him know this background check is a little involved, so she needs more time. For hours she scours the web for any information indicating Westermarck's criminal involvement, finding nothing. The only indication that anything is amiss are occasional gaps in time, a summer holiday or mysterious illness. His calendars suggest he spends a lot of time travelling through Europe or overseas on weekends, but there are no travel statements in his bank accounts indicating he purchased flights to any of these placecs. She is almost considering giving up, this might be a waste of time. <em>Maybe he just bought some drugs off of Lunderstr√∂m, or some fancy hunting rifle.</em> Her phone rings and interrupts her thoughts. It's Armansky.</p>
        <div class="dialogue">
          <p>"Hello?"</p>
          <p>"Hey, just letting you know you can drop the Lunderstr√∂m case."</p>
          <p>"What? Why?"</p>
          <p>"Hell if I know, the client says they're not going to hire him anyway."</p>
          <p>"Who exactly? Someone from the court office?"</p>
          <p>"They told me it was an urgent request from one of the justices. Not sure why they're in such a hurry, but they're still paying you in full, so don't worry about it."</p>
          <p><em>Westermarck. It has to be.</em></p>
          <p>"Thanks."</p>
          <p>She hangs up. <em>It's so obvious. Westermarck won't work with Lunderstr√∂m because he knows that fool will land him in legal trougle, or worse. There's no way I'm giving up on this now...</em></p>
