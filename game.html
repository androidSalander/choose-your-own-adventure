      <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
      <h2>October 6 - 19</h2>

        <p>In addition to a Supreme Sourt (H√∂gsta Domstolen), Sweden also has a Supreme Administrative Court (H√∂gsta F√∂rvaltningsdomstolen). Administrative court deals with matters of public law, often relating to executive brances of government. Examples include taxation and immigration.</p>
        <p>LISBETH SALANDER is working on a routine background investigation. A man named Felix Lunderstr√∂m is applying to work in the offices of the Supreme Administrative Court. Anyone else under Armansky's employment would have found nothing out of the ordinary. But with Salander's illegal and morally questionable methods, she has discovered Herr Lundstr√∂m has broken some laws of his own. Fortunately for her, Lundstr√∂m was sloppy. He restricted most of his illegal activity to the deep web, where he traded weapons and purchased illicit substances on a regular basis. But he would occasionally message contacts outside of the deep web using a form of encryption which was painfully simple for Salander to decode. She found his handle, "law_breaker", and rolled her eyes. Normally she would've typed up her report and had it on Armansky's desk in no time, and let him deal with the criminal proceedings Lundstr√∂m's activity was bound to provoke. But she had found something far more interesting than petty crime...</p>

        <p>Salander] found messages from Felix Lunderstr√∂m aka law_breaker to Supreme Administrative Court Justice Joen Westermarck. She hadn't found anything to explain what they are about, but Westermarck essentially yelled at Lundstr√∂m, telling him what a fool he is for playing fast and loose with his secretive online contacts in this way. <em>Justice Westermarck will likely be more of a challenge</em> Salander thought, and cracked a crooked smile before moving on. She emailed Armansky to let him know this background check is a little involved, she needs more time. For hours she scoured the web for any information indicating Westermarck's criminal involvement, finding nothing. The only indication that anything was amiss were occasional gaps in time, a summer holiday, or mysterious illness. His calendars suggested he spent a lot of time travelling through Europe or overseas on weekends, but there were no travel statements in his bank accounts indicating he purchased flights to any of these places. She almost considered giving up, this might be a waste of time. <em>Maybe he just bought some drugs off of Lunderstr√∂m, or some fancy hunting rifle.</em> Her phone rang, interrupting her thoughts. It was Armansky.</p>
        <div class="dialogue">
          <p>"Hello?"</p>
          <p>"Hey, just letting you know you can drop the Lunderstr√∂m case."</p>
          <p>"What? Why?"</p>
          <p>"Hell if I know, the client says they're not going to hire him so the background check would be useless."</p>
          <p>"Who exactly? Someone from the court office?"</p>
          <p>"They told me it was an urgent request from one of the justices. Not sure why they're in such a hurry, but they're still paying you in full, so don't worry about it."</p>
          <p><em>Westermarck. It has to be.</em></p>
          <p>"Thanks."</p>
          <p>She hung up. <em>It's so obvious. Westermarck won't work with Lunderstr√∂m because he knows that fool will land him in legal trouble, or worse. There's no way I'm giving up on this now...</em></p>

      <div id="email" class="hidden">
        <p>Salander guessed that Lunderstr√∂m would continue to be a sloppy idiot, so she checked his email. Half an hour ago <_law_breaker_100@hotmail.com> sent an email to a hidden address.</p>
        <p>"I'm sorry, ok?? You don't have to blacklist me."</p>
        <p>She had to laugh at that one. Especially because all of her assumptions had proved to be correct. A response from the hidden sender, two minutes ago.</p>
        <p>"Your stupidity continues to astound me. How many times have I told you not to contact me here? HOW MANY FUCKING TIMES?? I swear to God if any of your bullshit gets back to me I WILL HAVE YOUR FUCKING HEAD. Understood? Never speak to me again."</p>
        <p>Obviously he was right to be so concerned. <em>What are you hiding?</em> Apparently something big, because not 5 minutes after it was sent, his email and the one from Lunderstr√∂m were both gone, deleted. Out of curiosity, she checked the emails she found earlier that first exposed the link between Lunderstr√∂m and Westermarck. Those had also been permanently deleted. She got to them just in time.</p>
        <p>Lunderstr√∂m was now officially a dead end, and Westermarck too paranoid to make such obvious mistakes of his own. But Salander had a trick up her sleeve. A special gadget invented by fellow hacker and tech genius Plague would give her access to any file on Westermarck's computer. But it would be tricky. <em>It's about time for some field work.</em> Plague had given her a couple of his clever gadgets to test out when she had the time. A small cuff she could wrap around a broadband cable to begin a hostile computer takeover, while remaining undetected. It would take time for the cuff to completely download all the data she needed, but it's well worth the wait. She went to bed early, tomorrow would be a busy day...</p>
